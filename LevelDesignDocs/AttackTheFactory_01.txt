GOALS
Make a fun and dynamic level that challenges the player
Break up the gameplay, so its not always just tower defense
Give the player an objective to work towards, with some traversal of the environment and different groups of enemies
The mission should end with having to defend a location against a few waves of enemies, but player has to work their way towards this
Add a boss enemy
This level should be a real challenge
Add some degree of non-linearity
THEME: Infiltration




ELEMENTS
All enemy types
Exploding barrels
Conveyor belts which move the player and enemies
Crushing machines, which do damage to players and enemies
Pushers, which push things off conveyor belts




QUESTIONS
Is there a way to use the building mechanics in interesting ways?
    Build ramps to get to different areas?
    Use Walls to block conveyor belts so player can pass through?

How does the player get into the factory?
    Breach the gates?
    Get over a wall?


OBJECTIVE
The player must infiltrate a robot factory fighting or avoiding enemies to get to a central control point.
They must then defend this control point for a few waves while important data is downloaded.
Once the data is downloaded, the player must make their way to an evacuation point and escape.

SEQUENCE
Approach the factory
    Player starts outside the factory
    Player can see large defensive walls, and enemies patrolling the inside.
    Player knows that they will trigger the enemies to attack once they breach the factory gates
    Player has time to set up some defenses before they go into the factory
Breach the gates
    The player somehow gets inside the factory forecourt
    The enemies are alerted and a battle ensues
    This battle can introduce exploding barrels. Which the player can use now and later on in the mission.
    Once the player destroys this wave of enemies, they are free to explore and consider their next options
    There is a supply crate here which the player can optionally collect.
    The player can see a couple of different ways into the building, and is free to chose which path they take.
Inside the factory
    The player enters the factory, and finds it full of machinery and moving conveyor belts
    Initially the player is overwhelmed and confused of where to go
    The player sees the control center objective
        Now they know where to go, they just need to figure out how to get there

    Phase 1:
    The player is introduced to the conveyor belts, in a relatively low risk environment
        There are no enemies in this section, and the environmental hazards are not too severe - biggest risk is falling off, but will not fall to death
        Introduce control switches for changing conveyor belts
        There should be several 'checkpoint' spots that allow the player to pause and consider their next step before continuing
    The player needs to reach a raised walkway, to proceed to the next section

    Phase 2:
    The player now has to contend with fighting enemies as well navigating the conveyor belts
    Perhaps the player is on conveyor belts, while the enemies are on walkways on either side of the conveyors 
        Players will have to time their movement to avoid the enemies attacks, and also navigate the environmental hazards
    The player starts on the raised walkway, and has a chance to survey the next section before they attempt it
        They can see that they will need to drop down onto the conveyor belts, and they will be attacked when they do
        Although they can see the situation, they cannot preemptively attack the enemies - they are blocked by glass walls
    The player makes it through this gauntlet, and into an assembley area

    Phase 3:
    The player enters the storage area
    This is a large space, containing lots containers.
        There could be some environmental hazards in here as well
    The player has time to set up some defenses if they choose to
    Once the player reaches the center of the room, the containers open and enemies start coming out of them
        Can control the flow of the combat by choosing which containers to open when
    A large battle ensuses
    Once the enemies have been defeated, the player can proceed to the next area

    Phase 4:
    The player enters another large room, and is greeted with another maze of conveyors
    The player can see their objective, the control center, is on the other side of this room
    The player must use the conveyor belts to reach the control center.
    This time there are more environmental hazards to avoid
    Again, there are enemies on the sides of the conveyors, attacking the player, but there are also enemies directly on the conveyors, which will attack the player
        The player may be able to use the environmental hazards against the enemies
    The final section is a single conveyor belt with 4 crushers, which are all out of sync with each other - making it impossible for the player to get through.
        To get through this section, the player must find and activate the 3 control switches, which will synchronise the crushers, enabling the player to get through.
        Enemies continually spawn to attack the player through this section, meaning they have to defend themselves while finding the switches.
    Once the player makes it through the crushers, they are able to get off the conveyor belts and proceed to the control center.

Defed the Control Center
    The player enters a central control room with multiple entrances.
    At the center of the room is a control computer, which is the players objective.
    The player has time to set up defenses in this area before starting the first wave.
    The player has to defend 5 rounds in this area, and prevent themselves from being killed, and prevent the control console from being destroyed
    This is a hard battle, which will test the players skills. The rounds are long and will contain a lot of enemies.
    In the final wave, a boss enemy enters
        The boss is very big, has a lot of health, and does massive damage when it hits.
        The boss will spawn drones and shooters to defend it.
        The wave will not end until the boss has been destroyed.
Escape the factory
    Once the final wave has been completed, the player must escape the factory.
    The player makes their way back out of the factory, towards an evacuation point outside the main gates.
    More enemies spawn, and attempt to stop the player. The player can engage the enemies or run past them
    This section should not be as much of a challenge. This is more of a victory lap for the player.
    The player exits out the back of the factory
    The player reaches the evac point and the level ends



NEW MECHANICS TO BUILD
        Enemies can be alerted
        Enemy spawn volumes
        Make alerted enemies open front gate
        Doors and switches
        Conveyor belts
        Boss enemy
Way of triggering dialogue from the commander
        Crushers
Pushers
Explosive barrels
Supply Crates

--------------------------------------------

Stage 2: Entering the factory

GOALS
Add variety to the combat by adding traversal elements
Introduce new mechanics such as conveyor belts, and environmental hazards
Give a sense of jepordy to moving around
Integrate tactial combat encounters which utilize the dynamic space
Make a maze-like environment, where the objective is clear, but how exactly to get there requires some thought from the player
Introduce more verticallity
Utilize jumping


ELEMENTS
Enemy encounters
conveyor belts 
    Crushers, pushers, lazers?
    Conveyors moving at different speeds
    Conveyors moving in different directions?
    Conveyors at different heights, or distances from each other - requiring the player to jump between them
    Control panels to change speed or direction of conveyors?
    Robot arms which can knock the player off the belt?
    Maybe walls which temporarily block the player from attacking the enemies, or protect the player from being attacked
Catwalks
New enemies which can attack the player from a distance?
Ladders to help players get to higher sections?
Other risks to the player  
    Falling and having to redo a section
    Fall damage
    Falling into molten metal


OBJECTIVE
The player must navigate through the complex structure of the factory, and make it to the control center



SEQUENCE
The player enters the factory, and finds it full of machinery and moving conveyor belts

    Player can see large defensive walls, and enemies patrolling the inside.
    Player knows that they will trigger the enemies to attack once they breach the factory gates
    Player has time to set up some defenses before they go into the factory
Breach the gates
    The player somehow gets inside the factory forecourt

    This battle can introduce exploding barrels. Which the player can use now and later on in the mission.
    Once the player destroys this wave of enemies, they are free to explore and consider their next options
    There is a supply crate here which the player can optionally collect.
    The player can see a couple of different ways into the building, and is free to chose which path they take.
Inside the factory
    Path 1
        Path 1 is a longer path, which takes the player in at the ground level. 
        Entering the factory at this point alerts enemies inside, which swarm to attack the player. This happens before the player has time to set up defenses.
        Once the player defeats the enemies, they have the chance to look around. 
        If they player explores, they will find another supply crate
        The player finds a switch which opens the path to the next floor
        The player proceeds up to the next floor.
        The next floor is a factory floor, with conveyor belts moving around.
        From here the player can see their objective. But they can also see some enemies in between who haven't been alerted.
        The player has the option to set up some defenses before attacking.
        Once combat begins, the player must fight the enemies and avoid the conveyor belt obstacles.
        Once the fight has been won, the player finds a switch to open the path forward.
        The player is free to move towards their objective.
    Path 2
        Path 2 brings the player in higher up in the building.
        The player can see the enemies down below, but are able to avoid the fight if they stay up high.
        The player can see their objective, but realises that they will have to navigate a series of conveyor belts
        The player realises that if they fall down, they will be dropped in the middle of the enemy swarm.
        The player has to negotiate a series of conveyor belts. 
            Some of the conveyor belts have crusher machines on them. The player must time their movement so they are not hit by the crusher.
            Some of the conveyor belts have pusher machines on them. The player must time their movement so they are not pushed off.
            Some of the conveyor belts will speed up the player's movement, some will slow it down, depending on the direction of the belt
        If the player falls down, they start Path 1
        If the player successfully navigates the conveyors, they can proceed to their objective, avoiding the two battles.
Defense Phase
    The player enters a central control room with multiple entrances.
    At the center of the room is a control computer, which is the players objective.
    The player has time to set up defenses in this area before starting the first wave.
    The player has to defend 3 rounds in this area, and prevent themselves from being killed, and prevent the control console from being destroyed
    This is a hard battle, which will test the players skills. The rounds are long and will contain a lot of enemies.
    In the final wave, a boss enemy enters
        The boss is very big, has a lot of health, and does massive damage when it hits.
        The boss will spawn drones and shooters to defend it.
        The wave will not end until the boss has been destroyed.
Escape the factory
    Once the final wave has been completed, the player must escape the factory.
    The player makes their way back out of the factory, towards an evacuation point outside the main gates.
    More enemies spawn, and attempt to stop the player. The player can engage the enemies or run past them
    This section should not be as much of a challenge. This is more of a victory lap for the player.
    The player exits out the back of the factory
    The player reaches the evac point and the level ends
